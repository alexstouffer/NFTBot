# NFTBot

1. clone the repo to your local directory and `npm install` to download node_modules. 
2. Then swap the .env file credentials
3. Use the scraper.py script to download a collection to the /images folder.
4. Use the verify.py script to confirm all files have been downloaded for the target collection.
5. swap the contract in client.js, the collection name (#GEMMA), and the screen_name for your twitter handle.
6. I left testing code in there to see an example without posting. Make sure to draftTweet() when you want to run the bot for your collection.
